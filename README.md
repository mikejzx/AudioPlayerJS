# AudioPlayerJS
A little application I thought I'd write - using the Electron framework in a Node.js environment.
This could possibly be the replacement/successor/new-version of my MusicPlayer++ Win32 application,
as this app would be more portable and versatile due to the cross-platform nature of the Electron Framework.

# No builds yet.

# Build requirements:
* Electron framework: `npm install electron --save`
* node-id3: `npm install node-id3`
